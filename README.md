# ProJ

This repository is created for simple testing and practice projects for myself.

The goal is to try out ideas, experiment with JavaScript and other concepts, and improve my understanding through hands-on coding.

### 📁 Folder Structure (if any)

- `VanillaJS/` – JavaScript practice files.
- `...` – More folders or files may be added as I explore.

### 🚀 Note

This repo is mainly for personal learning and experimentation, so things might be rough or incomplete.

Feel free to check it out, but don't expect polished production-level code here. 😄
